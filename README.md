**Our team won 3rd place in the Gaming projects category at g.tec's BR41N.io Hacketon SpringSchool 2023, thanks to our innovative project that combined a 3D shooter game with a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology.** Specifically, we implemented the Unicorn Unity Hybrid Black BCI and the code-modulated visual evoked potential (CVEP) module, which allowed players to control their in-game actions using their brainwaves.

To learn more about our project and how we achieved this exciting feat, please check out our presentation on YouTube. We provide a detailed explanation of the game mechanics, the BCI technology we used, and our implementation process during the hackathon.

**Software Requirements**
- Unicorn Unity Interface Hybrid Black license (g.tec neurotechnology GmbH)

**Hardware Requirements**
- Unicorn Hybrid Black (g.tec neurotechnology GmbH)

**System Requirements**

We want to thank g.tec neurotehcnology GmbH and the BR41N.io SpringSchool 2023 for organizing this amazing hacketon. And all the professors and students of Tilburg University that supported us during the hacketon! :)

## Project Limitations and State
We want to be transparent about the limitations and state of our project. While we were able to successfully implement the BCI technology in our Unity 3D shooter game during the hackathon, please note that we were unable to access the Unicorn Unity plugin after the event, which prevented us from improving the project's documentation, structure, and testing of these changes:

- The project code is not well documented and the variables and folder names are fairly messy.
- The project may have bugs or issues.

Please keep these limitations in mind if you decide to use or modify our project. we have made every effort to make it as plug-and-play as possible. We encourage any feedback or suggestions for improvement that you may have. We also want to highlight that this project was developed with the Unicorn Unity Interface Hybrid Black license from g.tec neurotechnology GmbH, which is required to use the BCI technology. Additionally, please note that this project has only been tested on Windows and with the specific hardware and software requirements mentioned.

Overall, we encourage anyone who wants to use this project to carefully review the documentation and system requirements before attempting to use it. While we believe that this project has potential for further development, we recognize that it has limitations due to the time constraints of the hackathon.
